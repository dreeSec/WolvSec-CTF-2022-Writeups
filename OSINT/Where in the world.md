Challenge Description: 
User Vividpineconepig claims on to live next to a street that's above some train tracks. Where are they? Maybe finding their social media could help. Weâ€™ll give you a flag for tracking them down. Give us this elevated STREETNAME preceding the St/Rd/Ave/Lane to prove it.

Format: wsc{STREETNAME}

### Approach

Vividpineconepig appears to be the name of some unique user. The description tells us we might want to find their social media account. Using tools like [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) we can find possible social media accounts of unique users. Once we try instagram, we find the following account and picture:

If you run strings on the file, it will output hidden comments:

This is hinting that you will need to view this as a raw file in photoshop. This is also hinted in the description with RAW being capitalized. To convert it to a raw file, change the file extention from ".wav" to ".raw". Then, when trying to open the file in photoshop you are preseneted with the following options:

From the hint, we are given that the channels should be set to 1 and the depth should be set to 8 bits. These are also the default settings, so the hint was not necessarily needed.

flag: `wsc{t0t4lly_w1ck3d_dud3}`
  
### Note
At least one team was able to do this without the use of photoshop, and just online tools. Will add this method to the writeup soon!
